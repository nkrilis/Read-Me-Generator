  ## Description
  
  This application saves time for developers by automattically creating a professional README.md file for their repository, like this one. In fact this entire README was created using this program. Through the use of Javascript and nodejs modules we are able to ask the user a series of questions regarding their repository and its contents, and create a README from their answers.

  ## Installation
  In order to install this project you must first clone the repo to your local machine. Then run the command `npm -install`. This will install the necessary dependencies required to run the program, all of which are defined in the `package.json`. Once the installation is complete then run `node index.js`, answer all the questions with no limit to characters. Once the program is finished prompting you it will have created a `README.md` in the same directory. If you realize you made some mistakes you can run the program again and it will overwrite the previous `README.md`.
  ## Usage
  After you have spent hours coding and getting your project to work it may feel a bit tedious to create a README. For some it is as easy as answering some questions and viola your README is created. It will include headings, table of contents, licensing, badges, and even how to contact you. If you want to know how you can use this refer to [the installation section](#installation)
